"Lack of knowledge of the banking services provided by the bank itself. Hence handling of customer are not at requirements . Result customer service is affected, and to some extent customers are unnecessary harrassed.
However atitude and behaviour of all employees of the bank is excellent only lack of knowledge of the bank services offered by the bank itself. It is due to inadequate training offered to staffs/ employees of the bank. I being a shareholder of this bank faces multiple issues while opening a Savings Bank which should be regularise immediately.

The opening of account was very quick and smooth, however, when I received the welcome kit, it only contained my Debit Card while the covering letter mentioned that it'll contain a debit card and cheque book. I initially was a little worried when I couldn't find my cheque book in the welcome kit.

Eventually, I applied for cheque book containing 10 cheques through the IDFC First Bank app also I had to upload my signature to do the same.

Now branch official calling us and make presuure to deposit 50 lakh first to move normal account in first wealth and use harsh word. I talk to relationship manager and get to know that he is ill. After 3 days I again call him and after knowing that he recover, tell the issue. I surprise that relationship manager balim me that i am lying. 
After this I ask him to provide contact number of brach head but the same was not provided. I left no other option but to raise the complain with customer care. After lodging the compalin I get call from branch head and he again ask for 50 Lakh overall relationship to upgrade the other family members account whereas at the time of account opening i was informed AMB 10 lakh or AUM 25 lakh or ORV 50 lakh but all official including branch head mow read this OR as AND.
I ask the branch head if so then I am not interested in maintaining the accounts and share him email send by branch official before opeing the accounts, in which he clearly mentioned that all account cumulative AMB will be 10 lakh only. Thereafter he ready to upgrade the accounts and promise to send a email in this regard but the same was still not received.",0

Also, I was informed by customer service that a Justice of the Peace (JP) in Australia can attest identity documents, which I followed.

As far as I aware to make linked fd in IDFC Bank First, we have to specify the bank employee at the branch in person to make auto sweep savings account. Since the nearest branch is very far(>100km) from my current location this is not possible.

"The process of opening my joint account was unduly delayed, taking over three months to complete. It was a highly tedious and frustrating experience, requiring numerous visits to the bank for resubmitting documents and signing multiple times. Each resubmission was met with rejection by the back-end team, often without clear guidance, causing significant inconvenience and hardship. Overall, the procedure was unnecessarily cumbersome, and I was left thoroughly dissatisfied with the entire experience.

"I faced a lot of difficulties while opening NRE and NRO accounts. 1. As a first step, I tried contacting customer support multiple times and all they said I'll arrange a call back from the sales team which I never received, 2. no response from nriservices@idfcfirstbank.com as well. 3. I have to escalate to nodal officer and then Principal nodal officer. 4. Despite being an existing IDFC credit card holder, the customer care IVR system only provides credit card-related options, making it difficult to reach the appropriate team. To request a callback, I had to escalate to RNO, after which I was contacted via email to submit documents. However, there has been no follow-up since then. 5. Overall process took longer around 2 months. 6. The Branch employees are clueless and not aware the indepth knowledge which took longer turn around time to create account. 7. Lot of back and fourth with emails, branch visits, calls and ended up creating around 10 service tickets just to open NRE, NRO accounts. 8. Never received any welcome call or email to share product details after receiving welcome kit. Overall dissatisfied with account opening in your bank and I never encourage anyone banking with you.

I found out IDFC bank account opening while using FB. When I pressed the link it took me to the website and completed the process. One thing I would like to recommend is to inform new customers about the documents required. I had to look around for the documents during the process. I also had to pause the process to get out the get my documents attested. Prior suggestion would help shorten the time taken and also unnecessary hiccups. Some people may loose interest during the process as you have to go backwards and forwards.,0

"I recently opened an NRI account with IDFC FIRST Bank, and I must say the experience was absolutely wonderful. From start to finish, the entire process was smooth, quick, and hassle-free.

The bank's mobile app deserves special mention the user interface is intuitive, sleek, and extremely easy to navigate. It made every step of the onboarding process seamless and efficient.

A big shoutout to Riya from the NRI accounts opening team. Her support was exceptional, she was prompt, courteous, and extremely helpful throughout. Thanks to her guidance, my account was successfully opened within just one week!

I’m genuinely impressed with the level of service and the modern digital experience IDFC FIRST Bank offers. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a smooth banking experience, especially for NRI customers.",2

"The account was for Mrs. Sharayu Hibare. The primary reason for opening the account was for trading and it was clarified during account opening that it was to be a minimum balance account.

We were told that there is no option to open such an account and were insisted upon to have an account with 25,000 as a minimum balance. We categorically declined and when this was done, both the agent and the branch manager were unhelpful, and we were told to come to the bank to submit a letter to the same effect.

How is it possible that for a senior citizen, there is no option to open an account with minimum balance???

This is a very unhelpful way of assisting any customer, needing an account at your bank. We have two other IDFC bank accounts, but are very disappointed with the service that Mr. Kiran and this particular branch has provided.",0

"The agents do not take security of the personal documents seriously. I am afraid my personal documents are send via unsecured means and may subject to hacking and get into wrong hands. I am highly disappointed with the way my account opening process was handled.

It seems like they do not understand the requirements and way around NRE account openings. How the address work, how phone number works. They think all over the world it is the same like India.

It is so much pain to correct information in my account which was wrong from the beginning and pointed out during the account opening. They fill out forms wrong and when asked to correct it they try to say that this is how it is supposed to be.

It would be better to have only a few dedicated agents who knows well the requirements and restrictions around NRI documents and how contact number works.

I am highly disappointed with the way my account opening process was handled. I gave a new bank a chance but after my experience, I probably won't recommend any other NRI to open their account at IDFC.

I have lodged a complaint with Blue Dart directly vide email have still not heard back from them.
I strongly recommend that a different courier service be considered instead of Blue Dart. Even with other banks I work with Blue Dart is a perpetual problem. Blue Dart though is a third party it indirectly reflects badly on the bank using there services. 
I had to send my person to there office and still they did not deliver asking him to come back on Monday the 26th May 2025 for taking delivery of debit card. This is atrocious service of third party during account opening. ",0

"Dear IDFC FIRST Bank Team,

 

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service I have received regarding the update of my communication address.

 

I was contacted by your customer care team on 16th May’2025 and encouraged to open a zero-balance account online. I clearly informed the representative that I would proceed only after my home address was updated. I was advised that the address could be updated during the account opening process.

 

Following the instructions provided, I completed the process. However, I later received a message on 19th May’2025 stating that my welcome kit would be sent to the old address. Upon logging into the IDFC FIRST Bank app, I confirmed that my address had not been updated.

Since then, I have made multiple attempts to contact customer care and update the address via the mobile app using my Aadhaar card. Unfortunately, I continue to receive an error message stating, “Try again later.” Despite repeated efforts since 19th May’2025, the issue remains unresolved, and I have received no meaningful support or resolution from your team.

 

Due to this ongoing inconvenience and lack of response, I have decided to close this account. I request that you first update my communication address as per my Aadhaar card and then assist me in opening a new account with the same benefits that were originally offered.

 

Customer ID: 5297259775
Account Number: 10229832731

"Subject: Feedback on Account Funding Process at the Time of Opening

Dear IDFC FIRST Bank Team,

At the time of opening my account, I was informed that a cheque was required to fund the account. While I understand this may be a part of your current process, I wanted to share my personal experience with other banks such as HDFC and Axis, where the process was more flexible and convenient. In those cases, my account was activated first, and I was then given the option to fund it via NEFT/RTGS, which I found to be much quicker and more efficient.

Given that cheque usage is gradually declining and many customers now opt not to request a cheque book unless absolutely necessary, I would like to suggest that IDFC FIRST Bank consider providing multiple options to fund a newly opened account—such as UPI, NEFT/RTGS, or IMPS.

Offering digital alternatives would make the onboarding experience more seamless and in line with modern banking preferences.

I hope you will consider this suggestion to enhance customer convenience.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Chitra Vijay Game ",2

Now this package is returned back to the origin by blue dart on shippers request while it should have been scheduled to my current address as it’s not too far away from my aadhar address.
On the other hand I have tried many times to update my current address on IDFC app so it’s not allowing me do so.
I have even tried many times to connect to your executive over customer care number but it has not been possible to connect to any executive as IVR is not providing any t option to do so.

So plz arrange a call back to me to discuss further more regarding solution against this issue.

"India is lacking skilled labor. This is true. At IDFC bank as well. The person at Barakhamba Branch with surname JHA who opened my account on his mobile did a huge mistake. He selected Barabanki instead of Barakhamba and opened the account. And on pointing his mistake, i choosed to close the account right away. 

If such people can't do their job properly, why they are doing it then. It is the loss of bank only. I should have kept the account if it would have been Barakhamba branch. And now, my money is not with IDFC bank and even my referrals are not for IDFC bank now. 

I felt threatened while interactig with JHA that day because i pointed out his huge mistake. And he wanted me to leave the bank asap as i was sitting there and waiting to talk to some senior about it. 

Bank should hire people via strict vetting. As business may go coz of such experience. ",0

I have account in SBI, ICICI they are not ask like this, in SBI I need to maintain minimum balance rupees 5000 and ICICI bank minimum balance 10000.
If I look into IDFC bank they are asking to maintain 25000 minimum balance.

I had gone to the bank branch to enquire about the account opening, and they sent an executive for onboarding within 2 hours! Subrata was very understanding and helpful. The whole process was quite shocking for me , the account and NetBanking activation all online and within minutes compared to all the signing/documents required many years ago! He explained all the features really well and the best part was no unnecessary push for taking products like credit card etc.

Highly recommend Subrata for his great attitude and behaviour. Please convey the feedback.

"My account was open on physical firm , ms snehal kakde was handling it , form was submitted on 22 april with a cheque of 1 lakh , the account was opened on 23 april , and for online transaction I asked the account number for which ms snehal passed with wrong account number, i have proof also for the same , luckily i doubled check and no wrong transaction was done , but it's a big mistake from the employee side , and also after this asking for the cheque details, ms snehal kakde said that the cheque has sent for clearance on Wednesday but ,it was sent on Friday 25 april , and reason given to me was server down for straight two days which a absolute lie , henceforth i needed to cancel the cheque, this is the worst service one can expect, the employee are absolutely unprofessional towards their work .

I am highly satisfied with the professional and customer-centric service provided by IDFC FIRST Bank and look forward to continuing my banking relationship with you.

"The document verification team should know what a title deed ( ownership document) is. They were looking for expiry date of the document  assuming it was a rental agreement.  I provided the government web site were the validity of the document can be verified. But was not accepted by the team.
Similarly, I provided the latest utility bill for gas connection. The bill clearly says it's for a quarter ( ie. Issued every 3 months ). The team did not accept it. They demanded monthly bill.

"I was told by DBM that account would be opened under Wealth category and I should be receiving my wealth debit card within 3-4 days. Account was not opened in wealth category and I had to 5-6 follow ups to get the status and the wealth debit card. Overall experience with branch staff is not good. Had a discussion with branch manager as well and he was also sounding clueless. No update was provided by branch manager as well although he promised to revert. I didn’t get what was promised to me so not a happy customer. 
I have NRO/NRE accounts in other banks and services are great including the relationship manager assigned to me. ",0

"It is not difficult rather impossible to reach a customer care executive through your customer care number — the IVR system doesn't provide an option to speak to a human. Additionally, I did not receive a prompt response even after writing to the ombuds team.

"Namaste Sir, your bank is very reputed and has a prominent position in India for its good service and your bank provides good support to people in their financial matters.Our account was opened in your bank after getting loan approval through Paisa Bazar.But the way the female executive who called us for verification before giving the loan behaved with us, it seems that such people are worried about your bank.The result of not giving a loan is that we have taken loans in the past but there is no late fee or check bounce or cibill rank deficiency in it.Also, if our record is in default or we have a lot of outstanding loans, we also accept that our loan may be rejected even though the title is completely clear, but we are not only dependent on your bank.Our work is done, but we are giving this reply because if you keep such staff, your bank will only suffer losses in the long run. We are not sad that we did not get the loan, but we are sad that we did not get the right result.And it also makes sense that you need customers with defaulters and late fees, as well as those who are not practical, rather than those with good records
.Finally, I would like to say that I am sorry that you could not complete our valuation and that due to your failure, we were lucky to get a loan from a better bank than yours and at a lower interest rate. Your policy was good.Also, in the coming days, we will make this thing viral in our account, credit card account, my husband's credit card account, as well as in our group circle, WhatsApp group, Instagram, and we will inform you that IDFC Bank This type of service is provided so that we can show everyone our own experience of not opening an account in this bank.",0

"I found that a customer should not pick up your bank customer care executive call to open a savings account as he will not come forward to help if any issue arises at the same time bank employees in the account related branch won’t respect or cooperate as they lost business (for not opening account directly with the bank) from the new customer. Now I can’t find your customer care executive who advised me to open online account to resolve my issue or can’t get cooperation from your branch employees in Bangalore Yelahanka branch to get resolved my issues. This is management fault who can’t coordinate online customer care executives and bank employees. A customer should need to maintain good relationship with his own bran employees but online phone call executives spoiling these relationship joining in between. But management don’t want to sort out thus issues as they want only business. 
This is management fault.
I didn’t get my desired Debit Card because I opened online savings account with the advice of customer care executive. ",0
Compulsory Account open for granting loan is not good thing,0
"Firstly, please have the option of opening a joint account online as well. If you cannot, then do not mislead potential customers to the link of single account opening .
Secondly, the bank executives should be trained more on the basic understanding of joint account. My bank executives never mentioned tht we will get two customer IDs for transactions...I got to know abt it when I called customer care to enquire why all OTPs goes to other mobile number and not my mine.",0
